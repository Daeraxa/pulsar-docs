# esbuild

Seems they do successfully take JSX and turn it into JavScript that returns HTML content.

This could be used to create a website. But might be a little awkward.

# webpack

Seems to focus on something else totally.


# Emotion
Should absolutely be used for CSS


# React-Dom/Server
Could be used to convert JSX into HTML strings,

Maybe injected into EJS which can finally be compiled
